# Asteria Document V1 (Made By Specx & Andingly)

Asteria is a heavily glazed ogfn project that uses a leaked GS by magma.
He claims he "coded" his gs, However he uses magma gs. Claiming that its his with no sort of credits.
He also uses "Reload Backend" Which is also an open sourced backend made by Burlone413 & Andingly. (but no credits)
No Matter what if he uses this. Atleast give credits and dont claim its yours.
